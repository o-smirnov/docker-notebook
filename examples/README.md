# Example notebooks

## extended_rv_example.ipynb 

This shows off the rv (Result Viewer) frameowork. This will only work with 
example-reduction-dir from our shared Dropbox folder. Get example-reduction-dir here:

https://www.dropbox.com/sh/hde4azjdscsw20c/AAB2M0w3Ttm4ioPI0bccOPE-a?dl=0

In principle the dir should contain a copy of the notebook, but the one on
the github repo is guaranteed to be up-to-date.

To run:

```
$ cd example-reduction-dir
$ run-rv-notebook.sh        # from Owlcat, or a version of the script provided here
```

Point your browser to the indicated port (or forward the port via ssh if
working remotely), enter the example-reduction-dir directory, and load the
notebook.
